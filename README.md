# i3-renameworkspaces

Rename [i3](https://i3wm.org) workspaces to contain the names of the programs on them.

## Introduction

Workspaces in i3 have numbers and/or names, and can be renamed as documented at <http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces>.
This script connects to i3 via its IPC interface and continuously updates the workspace names to reflect the programs running on them.
The resulting names are prefixed with the workspace number, so all commands using `workspace number X` continue to work.

## Installation

Add something like the following to your i3 config:

    exec_always --no-startup-id exec i3-renameworkspaces.pl

## Configuration

The mapping between X11 window classes/instances and the used short names can be configured in the configuration file, which defaults to `~/.i3workspaceconfig`.
An example can be found in `config-example`:

```json
{
    "classes": {
        "firefox": "ff",
        "gnome-terminal": "term",
        "libreoffice-writer": "writer",
        "libreoffice-calc": "calc",
        "chromium-browser": "chrome",
    },
    "instances": {
    }
}
```

## Note

> How am I able to jump directly to these dynamically-named workspaces?

[In the i3
docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces),
there's a specific syntax to jump to the corresponding number of workspaces that
follow the naming convention `\d:.*`:

> Note that the workspace will really be named "1: mail". i3 treats workspace
> names beginning with a number in a slightly special way. Normally, named
> workspaces are ordered the way they appeared. When they start with a number,
> i3 will order them numerically. Also, you will be able to use workspace number
> 1 to switch to the workspace which begins with number 1, regardless of which
> name it has. This is useful in case you are changing the workspaceâ€™s name
> dynamically.
